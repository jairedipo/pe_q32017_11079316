odio
No, no, no I'm not bitter, I'm not mad
Well, maybe just a little, just a tad
I know every apple here ain't bad
But I found a worm in every single one I've had
Boys, they're only good for fruit, I mean, bananas
Boys, them boys are nuts, they drivin' me bananas
Oh boys, we should pack them up and ship them out
Boys, boys, boys
I hate them
I hate boys, but boys love me
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys, but boys love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I hate boys
If you hate them boys, shake it, now shake it
If you hate them boys, shake it, now shake it
We would all be happy, all be glad
If sweet momma nature never had
All these dirty little boys they think that the girls
Were only made for toys
Boys are so immature, they rarely turn into men
Then again, all men are dogs
All men are dogs
I hate boys, but boys love me (boys love me)
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys, but boys love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I hate boys
If you hate them boys, shake it, now shake it
If you hate them boys, shake it
Let's go
Boys suck, makes me sick
Inflated egos, little dicks
Use them up, spit tem out
I-H-A-T-E boys
I hate boys, but boys love me
(boys love me, oh yeah)
I think they suck and my friends agree (ooh)
I hate boys, but boys love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (hey yeah)
I hate boys
I hate boys, but boys love me
I think they suck and my friends agree (ooh yeah)
I hate boys, but boys love me (ooh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I hate boys
