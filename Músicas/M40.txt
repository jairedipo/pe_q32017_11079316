felicidade,amor
We always dreamed about this better life, this better life
We always felt it coming all along, yeah all along
We got the keys to open Paradise, yeah, Paradise
Now let's go walking hand in hand
Come on baby we can
Hit the lights
Make the wrongs turn right
We can smash the club
Make the pop go rock
With a love this deep
We don't need no sleep
And it feels like
We could do this all night
We could do this all night
Yeah everything is alright
We've got the keys to open paradise, yeah paradise
It feel like
We could do this all night
We could do this all night
Oh we can dance under the summer skies
The summer skies
The seasons change, our hearts will stay the same
Yeah stay the same
We got the dirty feelings, start a fire, start a fire
Give it a shout let's make it hot
Come on baby we can
Hit the lights
Make the wrongs turn right
We can smash the club
Make the pop go rock
With a love this deep
We don't need no sleep
And it feels like
We could do this all night
We could do this all night
Yeah everything is alright
We've got the keys to open paradise, yeah paradise
It feels like
We could do this all night
It feels like
We could do this all night
Come on baby we can
Hit the lights
Make the wrongs turn right
We can smash the club
Make the pop go rock
With a love this deep
We don't need no sleep
And it feels like
We could do this all night
We could do this all night
We could do this all night
We could do this all night
We could do this all night
